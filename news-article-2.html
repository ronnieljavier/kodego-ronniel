        <article>Bitcoin (BTC) turned lower after approaching resistance near $40,000. The cryptocurrency remains in a tight trading range, although support between $35,000 and $37,000 could stabilize pullbacks into the Asia trading day.
            BTC was trading around $39,000 at press time and is down 6% over the past 24 hours.
            The relative strength index (RSI) on the four-hour chart declined from overbought levels, which preceded a pullback in price. On the hourly chart, the RSI is oversold, suggesting brief periods of buying activity could occur. <br> <br>
            
            The S&P 500 has performed so poorly this year that it is now trading at a scarily low level. That usually presents an attractive opportunity for longer-term investors. 
            
            The market benchmark, down more than 11% for the year, just hit a “death cross.” That is when the index’s 50-day moving average falls below the 200-day number.
            
            It’s a signal that something is up in the market, if anyone needed more evidence. In normal times, when stocks are rising, the average of recent prices is higher than the figure for 200 days because the longer-term figure includes levels when stocks were lower.
            
            Stock prices have fallen below their long-term trend as investors consider the current formidable risks to the economy. <br> <br> The Russia-Ukraine war has led to sanctions on Russia’s commodity exports that have reduced the amount of those goods on the global market, sending prices through the roof.
            
            Consumers could pull back on spending as a result. Even before Russia’s attack, inflation was taking off, putting pressure on central banks to slow the economy in order to get prices under control. Already, central banks are expected to lift interest rates several times this year.
            
            The S&P 500’s death cross lands the index’s 50-day moving average at around 4,465. That is below its 200-day moving average of 4,467. <br> <br> All it would take for the index to close in a death cross is for it to end Monday below 4,377; it was at 4,199.90 in early afternoon. 
            
            Although that makes things in the stock market feel bleak, it is probably a good time for longer-term investors to buy stocks. Historically, the S&P 500 tends to post impressive gains in the 12-month period following an initial close in a death cross. Based on the 53 times the index has closed in death-cross territory, the average gain over that span is 6.3%, according to Dow Jones Market Data.
